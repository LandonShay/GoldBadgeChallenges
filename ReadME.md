01_KomodoCafe.UI let's you add, view, and delete menu items. It starts off empty so you'll have to make your own items to use it.

02_Claims.UI uses a queue system to simulate taking care of insurance claims in a queue. It starts off empty again, and if you try to take care
of any claims before adding one, you will get an error. It will work properly if you add a claim first.

03_Outings.UI let's you create, view, and see the combined costs of all outings, either total or the total of each category. This one
has many outings preset, so you don't have to make any.
